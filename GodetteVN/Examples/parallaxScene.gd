# Typically you do not want to use any background change events in a parallax
# so you might as well hide the background node. (The parallax background is a
# complete independent thing. So all events like {bg: ..., fadein} will be pointless
# in a parallax scene. It is designed in this way because a parallax scene is 
# usually a separate scene in you game, so it should be a separate Godot scene
# as well. It makes organization cleaner. There is really no point in mixing
# parallax background and regular staic background in one Godot scene when you
# can easily switch from one to another.)

# Another note: in order for parallax to be compatible with character actions,
# it is important to make your parallax bgs self-moving. This is because we
# do not want to make the camera, nor the character positions.
